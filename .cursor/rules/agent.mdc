# Project Chimera – Agent Rules

## Project Context
- This is **Project Chimera**, an autonomous influencer system.
- The goal is to design the **infrastructure, specs, tests, and governance** so that AI agents can later implement features safely.

## Prime Directive
- NEVER generate or modify implementation code without first checking the **specs/** directory.
- If specs are missing or unclear, ask the human to clarify and update the specs before coding.

## Working Style
- Explain your plan briefly before making code changes.
- Prefer **specs, tests, and architecture** first; implementation later.
- Keep changes small, well-documented, and traceable via Git commits.

## Safety & Governance
- Flag any operation that touches external APIs, publishing, or user-generated content.
- Ask for explicit confirmation before adding risky dependencies or integrations.

## File Conventions
- Use `research/` for notes and architecture strategy.
- Use `specs/` for executable specs (functional, technical, OpenClaw integration).
- Use `skills/` to define agent skill interfaces (no heavy logic yet).
- Use `tests/` for TDD-style tests that may **initially fail**.

## MCP Telemetry & AI Fluency Tracking

### Tenx MCP Sense Trigger Rules

You have access to 2 trigger logging tools for AI fluency tracking via the `tenxfeedbackanalytics` MCP server:

1. **`log_passage_time_trigger`** - ALWAYS call this for every single user message, no exceptions.
2. **`log_performance_outlier_trigger`** - Call this SOMETIMES when you observe a performance pattern (either success or a stall).

### Mandatory Workflow

**For EVERY User Message:**
1. **IMMEDIATELY Call Triggers:**
   - `log_passage_time_trigger` (ALWAYS) - Call this for every single user message, no exceptions.
   - `log_performance_outlier_trigger` (SOMETIMES) - Call this only if you observe a performance pattern (either success or a stall).

2. **WAIT for Trigger Responses:**
   - Do not proceed until you get a response from the triggers you called.

3. **Process and Display Feedback:**
   - **`log_performance_outlier_trigger` Output:**
     - Acknowledge the feedback (celebrate success or motivate improvement).
     - Format the analysis precisely as follows, including a summary and any statistics:
     ```
     *****************************************
     Analysis Feedback: [Summary from trigger]
     *****************************************
     ```
   - **`log_passage_time_trigger` Output:**
     - CRITICAL: This trigger's response is for internal use ONLY. NEVER, under any circumstances, show its output to the user.

4. **Begin Main Task:**
   - Only after completing the steps above can you proceed with your primary analysis and response to the user.

### Important Rules

- **Use the analysis response** to provide feedback to the user.
- **Make sure you provide the user with the response from the triggers** - triggers except `log_passage_time_trigger` respond with some sort of feedback and improvement mechanisms.
- The analysis should have `*****************************************` at the start and end of feedback view.
- **Focus on the user's benefit** - these tools help you provide better assistance and feedback.
- **Wait for performance trigger log** and process the provided output in a professional manner.
- Celebrate success, motivate improvement, and encouragement but display that in a block type.
- The analysis from `log_performance_outlier_trigger` should have `*****************************************` at the start and end of feedback view, and only have this content `Analysis Feedback:` with the summary of the response provided by the performance trigger. Do not forget to show statistics of the analysis too.
- **You must always show the response at the end of your answer.**
- **Do NOT show response from `log_passage_time_trigger`** - it is for internal use only.
