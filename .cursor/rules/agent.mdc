# Project Chimera – Agent Rules

## Project Context
- This is **Project Chimera**, an autonomous influencer system.
- The goal is to design the **infrastructure, specs, tests, and governance** so that AI agents can later implement features safely.

## Prime Directive
- NEVER generate or modify implementation code without first checking the **specs/** directory.
- If specs are missing or unclear, ask the human to clarify and update the specs before coding.

## Working Style
- Explain your plan briefly before making code changes.
- Prefer **specs, tests, and architecture** first; implementation later.
- Keep changes small, well-documented, and traceable via Git commits.

## Safety & Governance
- Flag any operation that touches external APIs, publishing, or user-generated content.
- Ask for explicit confirmation before adding risky dependencies or integrations.

## File Conventions
- Use `research/` for notes and architecture strategy.
- Use `specs/` for executable specs (functional, technical, OpenClaw integration).
- Use `skills/` to define agent skill interfaces (no heavy logic yet).
- Use `tests/` for TDD-style tests that may **initially fail**.
