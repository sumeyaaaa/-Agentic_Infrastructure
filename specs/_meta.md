- `openclaw_integration.md`: OpenClaw/MoltBook integration protocols

## Status

🚧 **In Progress** - Specifications will be completed in Task 2.1

## Principles

- **Executable Intent**: Specs must be precise enough for AI agents to implement
- **Traceability**: All code must align with specifications
